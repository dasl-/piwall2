        # This sleep rate limits sending to 5 MB/s. This is especially important when playing back
        # local files. Without the rate limit, files may send as fast as network bandwidth permits, which would
        # prevent control messages from being received in a timely manner. Without rate limiting, when playing
        # local files, we observed that a control message could be sent over the network and received ~10
        # seconds later -- a delay because the tubes were clogged.
        #
        # Another reason rate limiting is important is because the transmitted video can get corrupted if it is
        # sent too fast. Specifically, there may be missing chunks of the video -- the receiver won't receive all
        # of the bytes that the broadcaster sent. This corruption might occur on ~50% of the sends. Example
        # output without the rate limit:
        # https://gist.githubusercontent.com/dasl-/d06329d31df346b936419e394d364bc7/raw/7097647283435e888e8d5e1896e4472c7578273c/gistfile1.txt
        #
        # With the rate limit, all of the bytes are received. Example output with the rate limit:
        # https://gist.githubusercontent.com/dasl-/cf10aa4da8d47a96c219e38d2bcfd6d8/raw/3aa9378172a97a1a45a72fc234b647f93f735b03/gistfile1.txt
        #
        # My theory for why this corruption happens is that we are overflowing some buffer in the network
        # switch when we send too fast. This is because I observed neither send buffer errors on the broadcaster
        # nor receive buffer errors on the receivers.
        #
        # We used to rate limit via a `pv --rate-limit 4M` in our pipeline. But we found that this was for some
        # not able to prevent the corruption described above. I'm not sure why -- perhaps `pv` buffers input
        # internally and can emit output in bursty chunks, which might allow transient periods where we transmit
        # greater too quickly?? Some testing with `pv --no-splice --buffer-size 512 --rate-limit 4M` seemed to
        # work better and might have solved the problem, but that is quite fiddly.

        # In any case, replacing the `pv` clause with this sleep seems better able to
        # prevent the aforementioned corruption.
