# Youtube API keys

## What do we use youtube api keys for
Youtube API keys are used to search for videos to play and display the metadata for each search result. Each search query in the web UI results in two youtube API calls: `search.list` and `videos.list`.

### search.list
The first API call that is executed is https://github.com/dasl-/piwall2/blob/7359049ab13f2d4d639470f74ce3315a08f43352/app/src/api.js#L87[`search.list`]. We use this to obtain the search results for the search query. This has an API quota cost of https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/determine_quota_cost[100 points].

### videos.list
The second API call that is executed is https://github.com/dasl-/piwall2/blob/7359049ab13f2d4d639470f74ce3315a08f43352/app/src/api.js#L104[`videos.list`]. We use this to obtain metadata for each search result. This has an API quota cost of https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/determine_quota_cost[1 point].

### traffic by API method
You can open up google's https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/youtube.googleapis.com/metrics[metrics dashboards] for the youtube API (note: you may need to select your google project at the dropdown at the top). View the graph "Traffic by API method".

* `youtube.api.v3.V3DataSearchService.List` corresponds to `search.list`.
* `youtube.api.v3.V3DataVideoService.List` corresponds to `videos.list`.
* `google.discovery.Discovery.GetDiscoveryRest` does not appear to contribute to increasing your quota usage. I believe this is related to the JS google API client discovering what methods are available in the restful interface?

## Quota
We have a quota of https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started#quota[10,000 units per day]. As detailed above, each search request uses 101 points of quota. Thus, we can perform 99 search queries per day. 

Creating multiple API keys to increase quota is https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/developer-policies-guide#don%E2%80%99t_spread_api_access_across_multiple_or_unknown_projects[not allowed], although you can have separate keys for dev, prod, and sandbox. https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/aqou5b/youtube_api_v3_quota_issues/ejyzmnv/[Some developers] have had success creating multiple API keys, but https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39239982/youtube-api-quota-multiple-accounts#comment107701159_43214052[other users] got their accounts suspended by doing similar things.

You can view your https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/youtube.googleapis.com/quotas[quota usage here] (note: you may need to select your google project at the dropdown at the top). Specifically, look at the "Queries per day" graphs. A value for a given day (e.g. 1,212) means you have used that many of your quota points. Expect this to be a multiple of 101. This page calls out the time at which quotas reset for the day:

____
Daily quotas reset at midnight Pacific Time (PT). 
____


If you exceed quota for the day, the youtube API will return an error like this:
....
{
  "result": {
    "error": {
      "code": 403,
      "message": "The request cannot be completed because you have exceeded your <a href=\"/youtube/v3/getting-started#quota\">quota</a>.",
      "errors": [
        {
          "message": "The request cannot be completed because you have exceeded your <a href=\"/youtube/v3/getting-started#quota\">quota</a>.",
          "domain": "youtube.quota",
          "reason": "quotaExceeded"
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "body": "{\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": 403,\n    \"message\": \"The request cannot be completed because you have exceeded your \\u003ca href=\\\"/youtube/v3/getting-started#quota\\\"\\u003equota\\u003c/a\\u003e.\",\n    \"errors\": [\n      {\n        \"message\": \"The request cannot be completed because you have exceeded your \\u003ca href=\\\"/youtube/v3/getting-started#quota\\\"\\u003equota\\u003c/a\\u003e.\",\n        \"domain\": \"youtube.quota\",\n        \"reason\": \"quotaExceeded\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n",

## Environments
https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/developer-policies-guide#don%E2%80%99t_spread_api_access_across_multiple_or_unknown_projects[Google's docs] state that you can create multiple API keys per environment to have separate per environment quota:

____
An applicationâ€™s developer team is allowed to have separate API keys for test, dev, and prod environments
...
It is acceptable to have a separate API Project for each different use case of your API service. Examples include ... One API project for a production server, one for a development server.
____

If you create separate API keys per environment for reasons of separating quota, you will need to create each API key in a new google project, because API keys in the same google project share quota. You do not need a separate google account to create new API keys -- up to 25 google projects may be created per google account.
